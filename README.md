# how-to-git-gitHub

-------- ABOUT ---------------------------------------------------

- This is a repository that I created to take notes on
  how to use Git and GitHub

-------- CONTENTS ------------------------------------------------

- What you will find here?
	- A quick guide showing and most of the command lines
	  and explaining how to use them.
	- A "complete" guide that will aim to go one step further
	  than the quick guide, and talk about things like history
	  how it was created and how it is used.

-------- CREDITS -------------------------------------------------

        - There will be no colaborators in this project, and thus
	  the only working on it will be me, Gabriel Souza.
